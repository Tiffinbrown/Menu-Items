# Future Menu Item
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of restaurant menu sales, focusing on category-level performance over time. This project examines sales trends, customer preferences, and category breakdowns using visualizations and metrics to uncover actionable insights.

# 📝 Project Summary: Italian Dish Pricing & Availability Analysis
A restaurant approached me to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a new Italian dish special. My task was to provide data-driven insights on:

💰 Optimal pricing based on historical sales data across menu categories

🕒 Ideal availability times, informed by peak ordering hours and category performance

📈 Financial viability, including expected revenue contribution and comparison to similar items

Using sales data, I conducted an exploratory analysis to identify trends in customer preferences and category performance. My findings helped guide pricing strategy and launch timing to maximize profitability and align with customer demand patterns.

# ✅ Solution:
I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that provided comprehensive insights into all menu item categories, including a focused analysis on Italian dishes. The dashboard enabled the restaurant to:

Monitor sales performance by category and item

Identify trends over time (by hour, day of the week, etc.)

Evaluate pricing strategies and financial viability for a new Italian special

Make informed decisions on when to offer the dish based on customer behavior patterns
